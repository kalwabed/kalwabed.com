> I recommend using this technique for mid-low websites, such as: personal blogs, portfolios, etc. Due to this technique replacing React with Preact might fail in some applications.

1. Install Preact `yarn add preact`
2. In the next.config.js file add the following code:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  // ...other config

  webpack: (config, { isServer, dev }) => {
    // Replace React with Preact only in client production build
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
        react: 'preact/compat',
        'react-dom/test-utils': 'preact/test-utils',
        'react-dom': 'preact/compat'
      })
    }

    return config
  }
}
```

We will replace React with Preact only when building the client on the production side, which of course reduces the bundle size that users have to download by up to 30%!
