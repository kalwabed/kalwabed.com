<Content heading="Project purpose and goal">
  Starting from my anxiety where I often find properties that are sold but not easily accessible to many people. So we
  tried to build this website with the hope that property providers can advertise their properties easily and property
  seekers can easily find their ideal property.

  Creating a user interface using Bootstrap, then we use React and Nextjs for matters related to Javascript, I think
  that's enough. Nextjs is especially helpful for data-driven websites like this. Then we leave the display affairs to
  old-school Bootstrap, to speed up the processing process. In the data processing and API, we rely on Expressjs. In
  addition, we also use it to create an admin page where our admin will work later.
