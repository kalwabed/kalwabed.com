My 2 friends and I managed to build a project to publish the work of students in my school, SMKN 1 Banyuwangi. I am doing full-stack development, responsible for the client-side web and a web dashboard for content management.

The flow itself will be that users who want to upload their work to Kebunkode, then they must first have an account on the web dashboard. I know this is an inefficient flow, but this was our project when we were in our last semester at SMK.

Hopefully, this website will provide a space for the students of SMKN 1 Banyuwangi to showcase their final project at SMK.
