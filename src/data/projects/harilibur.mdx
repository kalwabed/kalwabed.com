Ever found yourself scratching your head, wondering exactly when the next national holiday is going to fall this week or this month? The anticipation is real, right?!

Well, the wait is over! I've cooked up a **super simple and handy website** specifically designed to be your ultimate guide for exactly that â€“ making it a breeze for everyone in Indonesia to find out those all-important national holiday dates!

## Lesson learned

Get this! This project's journey is quite the tale! It actually started way back in 2021, over in a [different repo](https://github.com/kalwabed/harilibur), where I first brought it to life using Next.js (back when it was just version 11!). Fast forward to 2023, and I had this ambitious plan to give it a complete rewrite using SolidJS. I saw it as the perfect opportunity to dive into a new framework and expand my skills. Honestly, the results were... well, let's just say not as thrilling as I'd hoped. I ran into this stubborn bug with data fetching in the Solid version, and while I knew I _could_ fix it with a bit of time, that time just wasn't on my side then.

But guess what?! Two years later, in 2025, I got another shot at a rewrite, and this time I _finally_ got my hands on Qwik, a framework I've been itching to try for ages! The best part? Because both SolidJS and Qwik use JSX, the transition was surprisingly smooth! It was mostly about making a few tweaks here and there.

And the outcome? **Absolutely thrilling!** This latest rewrite with Qwik completely **crushed** that pesky bug from the Solid version. I'm seriously hoping this isn't the last time I get to work with Qwik because, trust me, this framework is a total **hidden gem**. It's got its own unique vibe that sets it apart from the usual JSX crowd.

Yeah, yeah, it might sound a little like over-engineering, but hey, I'm all about the exploration and the thrill of discovering new tech! ðŸš€
