At the beginning of the pandemic era, everyone came together to find a way out of the problems they were facing, including the problem of access to information and technology. This is what motivated me to build a web that provides information about health facilities throughout Indonesia.

Some features that support users to be able to access information, such as

- Hospitals
- Isoman place (self isolation)
- and emergency contact for Covid-19 sufferers

## Feature

Since this website is what I will bring to the web design competition, where the judging is more charged with the design results, I put the functionality aside here. Some features like the search are just for decoration.

## Design

This site was born without a designer. I built it directly from my exploration of many websites out there. Web [wargabantuwarga.com](https://www.wargabantuwarga.com) is one of the sources of inspiration and information for Rumah Covid.

By the way, I also had the opportunity to [participate](https://github.com/kawalcovid19/wargabantuwarga.com#contributors-) in the [wargabantuwarga.com](https://github.com/kawalcovid19/wargabantuwarga.com) project, which helped me to build this Rumah Covid and finally win 2nd place in the web design competition.
