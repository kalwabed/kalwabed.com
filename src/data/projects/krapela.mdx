Website for an entertainment business in Jakarta. This website is a place to put event info and also reservations. In addition, this website will be a business profile that will be worked on custom with designs that have been previously designed by their team.

This project has produced 2 websites, namely: [krapela.live](http://krapela.live)(now), and a web in other domain to maintain all the content that is here.

## Content

For the content management of [krapela.live](http://krapela.live) I use a separate web. It is custom made for the needs of [krapela.live](http://krapela.live).
Because the web will be dynamic and require data communication with fast UI & UX support for creation and development, I use a combination of [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), and [NuxtUI](https://ui.nuxt.com) tech stack as a solution.

Regarding storing data and assets, I clicked on [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to bootstrap and pursue faster project progress.

## Lessons

I just realized that I missed a little in predicting what technology would be used in the [krapela.live](http://krapela.live) section. I think I was right to use [Astro](https://astro.build), because at first I thought this site would be completely static and only the ticket list section would be dynamic, based on the initial briefing. It turns out that I was wrong. The client wants all content on all pages to be dynamic. I think Astro is less suitable for this case, but the web is ready. It will take more time if I have to rewrite using other technologies.

I then wanted to rewrite it! And this time, it would use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). But due to time constraints, only the running text part of the Svelte component.
