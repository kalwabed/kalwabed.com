**Yang Kita-Kita Aja**Â ("Just us") chat is a simple application for exploring WebSocket technology with Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Firestore.

The first impression of WebSocket was that the implementation took some time for me to think about how it could work. I chose a case study of a chat application because it requires real-time data communication.

There are some parts of this WebSocket implementation that I find quite challenging and confusing, namely the allocation of rooms for sockets in each chat room. Fortunately, I use Firebase Realtime Storage to manage this kind of thing, so I can focus on other things that are no less complicated: the data structure of each user and their messages.

So far, the app is still very simple to be considered a chat app. There is still a lot of room for improvisation and features like notifications, authentication, file sharing, groups, and so on.
