A website where I can write freely about non-technical things. It's more about daily life and phenomena that happen around me.

I wrote it in Bahasa Indonesia because it's easier for me and my target audience to understand what I want to say.

## Guest book

In this guestbook section, I was inspired by [Lee Robinson's guestbook](https://leerob.io/guestbook). Here I made it simpler and freer.

This feature gives me a new experience with [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) as my place to store data in a MySQL database. Combining Planetscale with [Prisma](https://leerob.io/guestbook) makes this small web-building experience even more interesting, especially when I use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to make it even more perfect.

Another important feature is the notification whenever someone adds a message in the Guest book. I want to be notified every time someone fills it up.

For this reason, I added automation using a Telegram Bot that I created myself to notify me every time someone sends a new message to the Guest book.
