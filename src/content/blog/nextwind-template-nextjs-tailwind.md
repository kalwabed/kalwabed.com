Tailwindcss itself, from the way it is implemented, for me who departs from Bootstrap, to be honest, doesn't like it and it's too complicated; involves lots of classes just to get a component to work properly.

_"I don't think I'm going to use Tailwind, because it will take a lot of time and hassle, just don't want to"_, my first impression. Yes, that's how it is, people's hearts are easy to turn back and forth, saying they don't like it now instead they make something out of it, huft.

## Begin

The story started, Youtube sent notifications, there was a new video update channel with the topic of creating a website using Tailwindcss, there I read some people's comments and from there my perspective on Tailwindcss changed immediately, so I have a reason why I should use Tailwind, why I have to start. Initially I tried to make a static website, I wanted to know how far Tailwind works. The result? Tailwind is amazing.

## Decide

I decided to create a personal website with simple writing and documentation about what I had learned. The technology behind it uses Next.js and Tailwindcss, as well as direct implementation rather than spending my time learning more (of course learning first is also important). Armed with some experience from previous videos and experiments, [Tailblocks](https://mertjf.github.io/tailblocks/) help for example layouts, and [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) from Tailwind itself, be what we see now, of course there are still many shortcomings here and there, but this is an achievement in itself for me personally.

## Next

Furthermore, why do I make a template that carries the same system? first, because it will be useful for my next projects, to speed up the prototype setup process; lastly, because I feel it might also help other developers to build their websites, because with this template developers only need to focus on developing their programs without having to worry about the 'complementary ingredients' setup.

If you are curious, please visit the website demo at [nextwind.vercel.app](https://nextwind.vercel.app), or the source code is directly [here](https://github.com/kalwabed/nextwind), you can also find it on my Github account at [github.com/kalwabed](https://github.com/kalwabed), thank you.
