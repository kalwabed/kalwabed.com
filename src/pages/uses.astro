    <h2>Languages and framework</h2>
    <p>I still love the clean foundation of HTML and CSS, but for interactive elements, JavaScript reigns supreme. <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit's</a> efficiency and reactivity make it my framework of choice, and TypeScript's type annotations bring a welcome layer of confidence to my codebase.</p>
    <p>
      Previously, I’ve worked a good deal with <a href="https://react.dev">React</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next</a>. Professionally, I work/have worked in various framework flavors, including <a href="https://nuxt.com">Nuxt</a>, and <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>.
    </p>
    <p>My professional career has been deeply rooted in the JavaScript stack, with <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node</a> being my trusty companion. Now, driven by a desire to improve the web, I'm embarking on a journey to conquer <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> as well.</p>

    <h2>Code tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a>: my current favorite terminal editor. I've been a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> user for a long time. But this change has really allowed me to move faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Font: <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>. My favorite dev font since I first encountered it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a>: I’m also a fan of <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>, but Vivaldi is a great browser because it's the same Chromium-based, but with all the customization and utilization I need. I use <a href="https://librewolf.net">Librewolf</a> if I want to test in Firefox.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://konsole.kde.org">Konsole</a>: I've tried other terminals, but none seem to work as well. Since I've been using <a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> as my desktop environment, the support has been first class too.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>: I’m also a fan of <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>. I moved some projects to Cloudflare to have more control over the infrastructure.
